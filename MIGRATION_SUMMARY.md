# Migration from Bitbucket to GitHub: Summary

## The Issue

You're encountering an authentication error when trying to push to GitHub:

```
remote: You may not have access to this repository or it no longer exists in this workspace. If you think this repository exists and you have access, make sure you are authenticated.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://bitbucket.org/datapowa/dpcrm.git/'
```

## Root Cause

Your Git remote is still pointing to Bitbucket instead of GitHub:

```
origin  https://chiheb_hadjamor@bitbucket.org/datapowa/dpcrm.git (fetch)
origin  https://chiheb_hadjamor@bitbucket.org/datapowa/dpcrm.git (push)
```

## Quick Solution

1. **Create a GitHub repository** (if you haven't already)

2. **Update your remote URL**:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/dpcrm.git
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `dpcrm` with your repository name.

3. **Verify the change**:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## Alternative: Keep Both Remotes

If you want to maintain access to both Bitbucket and GitHub:

1. **Add GitHub as a second remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add github https://github.com/yourusername/dpcrm.git
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u github master
   ```
