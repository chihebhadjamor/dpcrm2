# CRM Simple - Improvement Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines a detailed improvement plan for the CRM Simple application based on the requirements specified in `requirements.md`. The plan is organized by functional areas and includes rationale for each proposed change.

## 2. Core Objectives

The primary goals of this CRM application are:
- Provide a simple, secure CRM solution for a small team (3 people)
- Enable tracking of client/prospect accounts
- Manage actions and follow-ups
- Maintain interaction history
- Ensure security through proper authentication
- 
## 3. Data Architecture Improvements

### 3.1 Entity Relationships

The current data model includes four main entities: User, Account, Action, and History. To optimize this structure, we propose:

- Implement proper cascade operations for entity relationships
- Add indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., Account.name, Action.nextStepDate)
- Ensure proper validation constraints on all entity fields
- Add soft delete functionality for all entities to maintain data history

### 3.2 Data Validation

- Implement comprehensive validation rules for all entity properties
- Add custom validators for business-specific rules (e.g., priority values)
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for validation failures

## 4. Security Enhancements

### 4.1 Authentication System

- Implement the required email/password authentication system
- Set up TOTP-based two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Configure proper password policies (complexity, expiration)
- Implement CSRF protection on all forms

### 4.2 Authorization Framework

**Rationale**: Proper authorization ensures users can only access appropriate resources.

- Configure role-based access control using Symfony's security system
- Implement voter components for fine-grained permission control
- Secure all API endpoints and controller actions

## 5. User Interface Improvements

### 5.1 Responsive Design

- Implement the two-column layout as specified in requirements
- Ensure mobile responsiveness using Bootstrap 5's grid system
- Optimize UI components for different screen sizes

### 5.2 Interactive Features

- Implement client-side interactivity using Vanilla JS or Stimulus
- Create dynamic loading of Actions when clicking on Account rows
- Implement dynamic loading of History when clicking on Action rows
- Add sorting and filtering capabilities to all tables

## 6. Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Database Queries

- Optimize Doctrine queries to minimize database load
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Use query caching where appropriate
- Configure proper indexing strategy

### 6.2 Frontend Performance

- Optimize asset loading through CDN as specified
- Implement lazy loading for dynamic content
- Minimize DOM manipulations in JavaScript code

## 7. Development Workflow

### 7.1 Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for all business logic
- Add functional tests for critical user flows
- Set up end-to-end tests for key features
- Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### 7.2 Code Quality

- Establish coding standards and style guides
- Implement static code analysis tools
- Set up code review processes
- Document all major components and functions

## 8. Deployment Strategy

### 8.1 Environment Configuration

- Configure environment-specific settings (.env files)
- Set up proper production environment optimizations
- Implement logging and monitoring solutions
- Create backup and recovery procedures

### 8.2 Maintenance Plan

- Schedule regular security updates
- Plan for periodic performance reviews
- Establish a process for feature enhancements
- Create documentation for system administrators

## 9. Implementation Roadmap

### 9.1 Phase 1: Foundation

- Set up basic project structure
- Implement entity models and database schema
- Create authentication system
- Develop basic UI framework

### 9.2 Phase 2: Core Functionality

- Implement Account management features
- Develop Action tracking system
- Create History logging functionality
- Set up user management

### 9.3 Phase 3: Refinement

- Enhance UI with dynamic interactions
- Optimize performance
- Implement advanced security features
- Conduct thorough testing

### 9.4 Phase 4: Deployment

- Prepare production environment
- Migrate and validate data
- Train users
- Deploy and monitor application

## 10. Conclusion

This improvement plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing the CRM Simple application according to the specified requirements. By following this structured approach, we can ensure that the application meets all functional and technical requirements while maintaining high standards of quality, security, and performance.
