# GitHub Authentication Fix: Summary

## The Issue

You encountered the following error when trying to push to GitHub:

```
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/chiihebhadjamor/dpcrm2.git/'
```

## Root Cause

There are two issues causing this authentication failure:

1. **Username Typo**: The remote URL contains "chiihebhadjamor" (with two "i"s) while your actual username is "chihebhadjamor" (with one "i").

2. **GitHub Authentication**: GitHub no longer accepts password authentication for Git operations and requires a personal access token instead.

## Quick Solution

### 1. Fix the Username Typo

Run our automated script:

```bash
chmod +x fix_github_remote.sh
./fix_github_remote.sh
```

Or manually update the remote URL:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/chihebhadjamor/dpcrm2.git
```

### 2. Use a Personal Access Token for Authentication

When pushing to GitHub, use a personal access token instead of your password:

1. Create a token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Select "repo" permissions
3. Use this token as your password when prompted during `git push`

## Verification

After fixing the remote URL and using a personal access token, you should be able to push successfully:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```
