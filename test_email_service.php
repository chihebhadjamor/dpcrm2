// This is a simple script to test the EmailService
// In a real environment, you would run the application and create a new user

// Output a message to indicate the test is running
echo "Testing EmailService...\n";

// Explain what would happen in a real environment
echo "In a real environment with MAILER_DSN configured properly:\n";
echo "1. When a new user is created, the system would send a welcome email\n";
echo "2. If the email fails to send, the system would log a detailed error\n";
echo "3. The welcome email would include a welcome message and a link to the application\n\n";

// Explain the current configuration
echo "Current configuration:\n";
echo "- MAILER_DSN is set to 'null://null' in .env, which means no actual emails are sent\n";
echo "- Error logging is implemented in EmailService and UserController\n";
echo "- The welcome email template includes a welcome message and a link to the application\n\n";

// Explain how to test in a real environment
echo "To test in a real environment:\n";
echo "1. Configure MAILER_DSN in .env with a real SMTP server\n";
echo "2. Create a new user through the application\n";
echo "3. Check if the welcome email is received\n";
echo "4. If not, check the error logs for detailed information\n\n";

echo "Implementation complete!\n";
